        <h1>The Ant and Dove</h1>
        <img src="The-ant-and-the-Dove.jpg" width="450px" height="300px">
        <div id="story">
            One day an ant came to the bank of a river to drink water. The river current seemed high that afternoon, and the ant
            suddenly slipped and fell into the water. The ant was being swept away by the stream. The ant feared that it might be
            its last day.
            
            Thankfully, a kind dove saw the struggling ant. The dove dropped a leaf into the water so that the ant could climb into
            it. The ant climbed onto the leaf. The dove carefully pulled the leaf out of the stream to the shore. The kind dove
            saved the ant’s life.
            
            After a few days, a fierce hunter came to the forest. The hunter saw the beautiful dove on the tree and aimed to shoot
            his arrow at it. The ant, which was saved by the kindness of the dove, saw the hunter aiming at his savior. The ant
            wanted to save the dove from the hunter. So, Before the hunter could release his arrow, the ant bit the hunter on his
            foot. The hunter shouted due to the pain from the ant’s bite. The dove was alarmed by the noise created by the hunter
            and flew to a safer place.
            
            Moral: Every good deed we do for others will return to us.
